# Why my inine styles are not working?

I found this problem a few days ago. When I was trying to style an image component.

```js
<ImageComponent style={{ width: "300px" }} />
```

So far everything was ok... but when I wanted to add something else like:

```js
<ImageComponent style={{ border-radius: "50px" }} />
```

<blockquote display="warning">
  It didn't work at all. And it's sometimes hard when styles are not taken by
  the component without explicit tips which can help you to debug.
</blockquote>

So the trick I found out is just about syntax:

<blockquote display="info">
  Whenever the css property is longer than 1 word and it is separated by a -
  such as: border-radius or margin-left, then you need to wrap the property
  between brackets the same way you do with the value:
</blockquote>

```js
<ImageComponent style={{ "border-radius": "50px" }} />
```
